**KanBan & Fulfilment analysis created in 2010**

## Situation
One of the key customers wished to setup a KanBan via EDI to allow their system raising orders based on their live production demand. Their production can be hectic and sending a forecast didnâ€™t prevent some production stop Their IT system for EDI was not aligned with ours which preventing  straight setup.

## Task
To avoid potential production stop and working alongside the EDI setup, I have implemented an offline KanBan system.

## Action
Taking into consideration their stock level as well as ours, their forecast  and any firm demand in our ERP, I created an excel table to quickly highlight if there will be a shortage with the next 12 months based on current demands

## Result

This has prevented several production line stop at the customer and alter them a shortage in part. The tool also helped to adjust their own stock while awaiting to have the EDI setup. This temporally tool helped to reinforce the relationship with the customer and the CEO thanks us for the continuous support during the transition to EDI.
